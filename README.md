## Introduction

This is a repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.

I'm using this as an opportunity to use every language I can think of to solve the puzzles. I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn more about the languages I'm using.

I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD).

_My main goal here is just to follow regular training and practice and developping something else than applications (Bot, Website, Software, etc..)._
